# Introduction

**tknOps** is a comprehensive AI cost and usage analytics platform designed to give you full visibility into your LLM operations. It helps you track costs, monitor usage, and gain insights into user behavior across your AI applications.

## Components

The platform consists of three main components that work together:

1.  **Python SDK (`tknops-llm`)**: A lightweight library that integrates into your Python application to automatically capture and send usage data (tokens, latency, model info) to the tknOps platform.
2.  **REST API**: The backend service that receives telemetry data and provides endpoints for programmatic access to analytics and management features.
3.  **Dashboard**: A web-based interface for visualizing your data, managing projects, and setting up organizations.

## How it Works

1.  **Instrument**: Install the SDK in your AI application and initialize it with an API Key.
2.  **Track**: Wrap your LLM calls (OpenAI, LangChain, etc.) with the SDK's tracking methods.
3.  **Analyze**: View real-time dashboards to see cost breakdowns by user, model, and project.

## Getting Started

To get started, we recommend following this path:

1.  **[Onboarding](/dashboard/onboarding)**: Create your account and organization.
2.  **[Installation](/sdk/installation)**: Install the Python SDK.
3.  **[Quickstart](/sdk/quickstart)**: Send your first event.
