# Authentication

The tknOps API uses **API Keys** to authenticate requests. You can view and manage your API keys in the **Project Settings** page of the [Dashboard](/dashboard/projects).

## HTTPS Only

All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over plain HTTP will be redirected or fail.

## Authenticating Requests

To authenticate a request, include your API key in the `X-API-Key` header.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.tknops.io/track/ \
  -H "X-API-Key: tkn_live_..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  ...
```

> [!WARNING]
> Your API Key carries many privileges, so be sure to keep it secure! Do not share your secret API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, etc.

## Handling Errors

If your API key is missing or invalid, the API will return a `403 Forbidden` or `401 Unauthorized` error.

| Code | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `401` | Content of the API Key header is missing or invalid format. |
| `403` | The API Key provided is not valid or has been revoked. |
