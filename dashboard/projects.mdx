# Projects

Projects allow you to organize your AI usage by application, environment, or feature. For example, you might have separate projects for "Chatbot - Prod" and "Chatbot - Dev".

## Creating a Project

1. Navigate to the **Projects** tab in the sidebar.
2. Click **New Project**.
3. Enter a name for your project.

## API Keys

Each project has its own set of API Keys. These keys are required to authenticate the SDK and API requests.

### Generating a Key

1. Select your project from the sidebar.
2. Go to the **Settings** or **API Keys** section.
3. Click **Create New Key**.
4. Give it a name (e.g., "Production Server").
5. **Copy the key immediately**. You will not be able to see the full key again for security reasons.

### Revoking a Key

If a key is compromised, you can revoke it instantly:
1. Find the key in the list.
2. Click the **Delete** or **Revoke** icon.
3. Confirm the action. Any applications using this key will immediately stop working.
