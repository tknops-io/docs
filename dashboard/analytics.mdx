# Analytics Dashboard

The **Analytics** page is the central hub for monitoring your AI operations. It provides real-time visibility into costs, latency, and volume.

## Key Metrics

### Total Cost
The estimated total cost in USD for the selected time period. This is calculated based on the number of input/output tokens and the pricing model of the specific provider (e.g., GPT-4 vs GPT-3.5).

### Token Usage
- **Input Tokens**: The number of tokens sent in the prompt.
- **Output Tokens**: The number of tokens generated by the model.
- **Total Tokens**: The sum of input and output tokens.

## Filtering & Grouping

You can filter the data by:
- **Date Range**: Last 24h, 7 days, 30 days, or custom.
- **Model**: Filter by specific models (e.g., `gpt-4`).
- **User**: See usage for a specific end-user ID.
- **Tags**: Filter by custom tags you sent via the SDK (e.g., `prod`, `experiment-A`).

## Events Log

At the bottom of the dashboard, you can see a raw log of individual events. Click on an event to see more details, including the full prompt and response (if content collection was enabled).
