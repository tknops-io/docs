Welcome to tknOps! This guide will help you set up your account and organization so you can start tracking your AI usage.

## 1. Create an Account

- **Slug**: A unique URL-friendly identifier (e.g., `acme-corp`). This is used in the URL structure.

## 3. Invite Team Members

Once your organization is set up, you can invite your colleagues.
